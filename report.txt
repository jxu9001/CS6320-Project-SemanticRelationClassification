1. There were 8 sentences where the model correctly predicted the relation but incorrectly predicted the direction.
2. When the model incorrectly predicted Cause-Effect, the most common correct relation is Product-Producer (3 sentences). 
   However, there are 3 sentences where the model correctly predicted Cause-Effect but predicted the wrong direction. 
3. When the model incorrectly predicted Component-Whole, the most common correct relation is Other (5 sentences).
4. When the model incorrectly predicted Product-Producer, the most common correct relation is Other (8 sentences).
5. When the model incorrectly predicted Instrument-Agency, the most common correct relation is Component-Whole (2 sentences).
6. When the model incorrectly predicted Other, the most common correct relation is Component-Whole (8 sentences).

Lessons Learned:
This assignment taught me how to implement complex neural network architectures in Keras. 
I used the output of the bidirectional LSTM layer as the inputs to two separate Dense layers.
One Dense layer predicted the relation while the other Dense layer predicted the direction of the relation.
I also learned how to implement custom loss functions in Keras.
Predicting the relation is more important than predicting the direction of the relation.
Therefore, I penalized the model more if it incorrectly predicted the relation than if it incorrectly predicted the direction of the relation.
I also learned about some issues when dealing with unbalanced data. 
Because there were so many sentences classified as "Other," I tried deleting some of those sentences in order to create a more balanced dataset.
However, this dramatically hurt the model's performance on both the train and test sets.
